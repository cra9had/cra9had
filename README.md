# Hello 👋  

I'm a Python Developer with 5+ years of experience.  

I love building projects that make technology more practical and useful for people. My journey in programming started with a simple YouTube video about Python, and since then I’ve grown from writing small scripts to leading full-stack development teams and building scalable applications.  

I’ve worked on everything from complex Telegram bots and marketplaces to high-volume data platforms and AI-powered web apps.
